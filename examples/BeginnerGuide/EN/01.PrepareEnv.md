# Preparing the Environment

Before running, we need to set up the environment for LightX2V.

## Method 1: Linux + Docker Environment

We highly recommend running LightX2V in a Docker environment. This ensures consistency with our runtime environment and minimizes potential issues.

Refer to the [quickstart guide](https://lightx2v-en.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/quickstart.html).

The Docker image we provide already includes all necessary dependencies.
