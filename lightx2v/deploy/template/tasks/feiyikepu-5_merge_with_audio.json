On the screen, shadow puppets move gracefully to the sound of stringed instruments, their silhouettes shifting with light and shadow as the peking opera blues' plumes dance vigorously and the wusheng's martial moves are sharp and decisive. Suddenly, the rhythmic beats of the gongs and drums intensify, and her eyes brighten. With a gentle gesture, she points toward the screen, weaving together the historical lineage and artistic charm of shadow puppetry, along with the evocative essence of light and shadow that has transcended a century.",
